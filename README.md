One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.

>My project allows indecisive users to decide on what food to eat for their next meal (random food generator). Users can “favourite” that food so that it’ll be in their favourite list and they can use this list to decide on what to eat again. For each food they eat based on the random food, they can earn points in the leaderboard.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

>As a user i want to be able to be able to generate food based on my diet so that i can decide on what to have for my next meal.
>As a user i want to be able to create an account/sign in to my existing account so that i can earn points and compete against other foodies as well as setting my diet restrictions so that the food generated would be something i can consume.
>As a user i want to be able to save my favourite food items so that i can generate food from my favourite list.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

>Feature 1 - allows users to use the random food generator to generate food to have for their next meal.
>Feature 2 - allows users to create an account/sign in to my existing account so that they can earn points and compete against other foodies and also to set their diet restrictions.
Feature 3 - allows users to save their favourite food items so that they can generate food from their favourite list.

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
