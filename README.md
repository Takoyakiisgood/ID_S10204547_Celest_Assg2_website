<h1>Random Food Generator</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

My project allows indecisive users to decide on what food to eat for their next meal (random food generator). Users can “favourite” that food so that it’ll be in their favourite list and they can use this list to decide on what to eat again. For each food they eat based on the random food, they can earn points in the leaderboard.

<h2>Design Process</h2>

<li>As a user i want to be able to be able to generate food based on my diet so that i can decide on what to have for my next meal.</li>
<li>>As a user i want to be able to create an account/sign in to my existing account so that i can earn points and compete against other foodies as well as setting my diet restrictions so that the food generated would be something i can consume.</li>
<li>>As a user i want to be able to save my favourite food items so that i can generate food from my favourite list.</li>

<h2>Features</h2>

<li>>Feature 1 - allows users to use the random food generator to generate food to have for their next meal.</li>
<li>>Feature 2 - allows users to create an account/sign in to my existing account so that they can earn points and compete against other foodies and also to set their diet restrictions.</li>
<li>Feature 3 - allows users to save their favourite food items so that they can generate food from their favourite list.</li>

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
